# IN THE BEGINNING 开始

**The Challenge of Power** **权力的挑战**

> If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.
> 如果你希望权力被用在好的地方，那就应该让更多好人拥有权力。

> ——我的一句名言

I REGULARLY SUFFER A FORM of what might be called intellectual whiplash. On the one hand, people—even a good friend and insightful editor—tell me my ideas about power don’t fit the prevailing zeitgeist with its emphasis on collaboration, being nice, and enacting politically correct behavior. On the other hand, I get emails like the one from an individual enrolled in my online class on power. That person told me and his classmates that he learned that performance is not enough. Rather, he now knew he had to ask people in power in his company for what he wanted and needed to advance his career and achieve his job objectives and to flatter higher-ups; to believe in himself and act and speak with power; to build a network and support system; and, when confronting opposition and conflict, to be smart in how and when to fight his battles. And oh, by the way, he would miss my final live session because his network-building and “get noticed” efforts had resulted in his being on the corporate plane with two C-level officers to make an international market visit at the same time as the session.
我经常遭受到一种所谓的“智力鞭挞”。一方面，人们——甚至是我的一个富有洞察力的编辑朋友——告诉我，我对权力的看法不符合以合作、友好和政治正确为盛的主流时代思潮。另一方面，我收到像来自于参加我的在线权力课程的一位学生的一些邮件。这个人告诉我和他的同学们，他学到了只是表现是不够的。相反，他现在知道了，他需要向去他公司里的当权者索要他想得到的东西、发展事业、达成工作目标和奉承上级；去变得自信，言行充满权力；去搞关系和支持系统；以及，当面对竞争者和矛盾时，知道何时以及怎么去作战。顺带一提，他即将错过我的最后一堂直播课，因为课程的同时，他的社交和引人注目的努力使得他将在公司专机上和两位C级官员一起做一场国际化的市场考察。

So, what to believe about power? How to act—what to do? *7 Rules of Power* captures my current thinking and the most recent social science research to help you answer those questions.
所以，关于权力我们该相信什么？我们应该如何表现——即我们应该做什么？《权力七规则》一书涵盖了我当下的想法以及最新的社会科学研究，来帮你解答这些问题。

## WHY THIS BOOK, NOW? 为何现在写这本书？

I thought I would never write another book on power. I have written three, four if you count a prequel that confronts leadership aphorisms that are mostly untrue and unhelpful, like recommendations to be modest, authentic, and truthful. My last two books on power have done reasonably well, being used in classes literally worldwide; why this book, and why now?
我曾认为我不会再写任何关于权力的书了。我已经写了三本，如果你算上一本前传的话是四本，这本前传直面了像“求职介绍应该是谦虚、真实和可信的”这类领导力格言几乎是虚假和无用的。我最近的两本关于权力的书籍已经不出所料地成功，正在被广泛用于全球的课程中；我为何现在又要写这本书呢？

Four things changed my mind. First, I have continued my efforts to convey material on organizational power and politics ever more effectively. I have the privilege of doing so for some of the most talented people in the world, both online and in person. This activity has deepened my insights about how to simplify, clarify, and articulate more clearly the ideas behind rules of power—how and why people can take actions that, very practically and often quickly, will alter their career trajectories and their lives.
四件事改变了我的想法。首先，我继续努力去更加有效地输送与组织权力和政治相关的物料。我有特权去为世界上一些很有天赋的人做这些，包括在线和私下。这项活动加深了我的洞察力，关于如何更清晰地简化、阐明和表达我对权力规则的看法——如何以及为何人们能通过行动极其实际和迅速地改变事业轨迹和生活。

Students have shown me how learning the rules of power and their application can have profoundly positive and immediate effects. A recent, not unusual email:
学生们向我展示了如何学习权力规则，以及他们对这些规则的运用已经能够极大地产生正面和快速的影响。以下是一封最近并不罕见的电子邮件：

> *Thank you for all the lessons from your . . . class. It helped me start my own department, get a salary and title I never considered at my age, and today it got me praise from two ministers during an international signing ceremony. What’s the secret? I simply asked for things. I also took your advice of strategically placing myself in places where my . . . degrees and AI knowledge are considered very rare instead of common. Lastly, I invested in putting myself out there, networking with those at work, and building a name for myself.*
> 感谢你的……课堂上的每一节课。它帮助我建设自己的部门，获得我在这个年纪不敢想象的薪水和头衔，以及今天它使我在一个国际签署仪式上得到了两位部长的赞扬。这其中的秘密是什么？我只是简单地索取。我也听取了你的建议，把自己放在我的……学历和AI知识相较而言非常欠缺的位置。最后，我投入到放手一搏，和同事搞关系和建设个人品牌。

None of what this individual, a Saudi national working for Aramco, described is rocket science, although all of what they did is consistent with social science evidence—and all too infrequently implemented. That this example comes from a different country and culture suggests what research evidence says: the rules of power are quite general and hold across cultures. Because of the positive effects of this material, I thought I should share my expanding capability to teach about organizational power and, more broadly, my most recent insights about helping people on their path to power.
这是个为沙特阿拉伯国家石油公司工作的沙特阿拉伯人，他所描述的都不是高深的学问，尽管他们的所作所为与社会科学证据相符——但很少被应用到。这个来源于不同国家和文化的例子反应了一项研究证据：权力规则是非常普遍的和跨文化的。由于这个素材的正面影响，我认为我应该花费一部分精力去教授组织权力，以及更广泛地，帮助人们获得权力的最新洞见。

### The Magic Number Seven 魔法数字七

After observing my former students as well as political and business leaders (particularly successful ones), and reviewing the relevant social science, I concluded that there were basically seven rules of power. Organizing lessons about power into these seven fundamental rules is an effective way to teach people what they need to do to have more influence and success.
在观察了我之前的一位具有（尤其成功的）政治和商业领袖身份的学生，以及回顾了相关社会科学研究之后，我总结出了七条基本的权力规则。将权力课程组织成这七条基本的规则是一个有效的方式，来教会人们为了取得影响力和成功需要做些什么。

Seven turns out to be a good number of rules. In 1956, George Miller wrote an influential article arguing that “the unaided observer is severely limited in the amount of information he can receive, process, and remember,” with seven elements or ideas, plus or minus two, constituting most people’s capacity. A more recent analysis of Miller’s argument noted that “the number 7 occurs in many aspects of life, from the seven wonders of the world to the seven seas and seven deadly sins.” Further research has consistently confirmed the validity and robustness of Miller’s original insight about cognitive limitations once one gets much beyond seven items.
七是一个关于规则的好数字。1956年，乔治·米勒写了一篇很有影响力的文章论证了“独立的观察者会被严重受限于他所能接收、处理和记忆的信息量之内”，而七（加上或者减去二）个元素或想法，被认为是大多数人的信息容量。一项更新的关于米勒的论点的分析指出“数字7出现在生活中的各个方面，例如世界七大奇迹、七大海洋和七宗罪”。进一步研究一贯确认了米勒这一独到见解的正确和可靠，即认知的局限性限制了人们一次性获取超过七个信息。

Fortunately, my ideas about the building and use of power can be effectively captured in seven rules, which constitute the chapters of this book. The seven rules are:
幸运的是，我的关于权力建设和使用的想法可以被有效地涵盖进七条规则，也就是这本书的各个章节。这七条规则是：

1. Get out of your own way. 自我突破
2. Break the rules. 打破规则
3. Appear powerful. 表现得很有权力
4. Build a powerful brand. 建立个人品牌
5. Network relentlessly. 发展社会关系
6. Use your power. 使用权力
7. Success excuses almost everything you may have done to acquire power. 成功几乎胜过任何你获得权力时所做的一切

I believe the seventh rule to be one of the more important, as it can cause people to act rather than worry needlessly about consequences.
我相信第七条规则是更为重要的一条，因为它能使人行动起来，而不是对后果抱有不必要的担心。

### Explaining the Current Leadership Landscape 当下领导力全景解释

The second factor that changed my mind was the observable reality of contemporary political and business leaders, including but certainly not limited to people like Donald Trump, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, and Elon Musk, that I find people do not understand. Many people consider these individuals and their behaviors anomalies, but fail to recognize that as they exemplify the rules of power, these leaders offer important lessons about contemporary—yes, contemporary, not ancient—successful leadership behavior.
第二个改变我想法的因素是当代的政治和商业领袖（包括但不限于像唐纳德·特朗普、史蒂夫·乔布斯、杰夫·贝索斯、比尔·盖茨、梅格·惠特曼、卡莉·菲奥莉娜和埃隆·马斯克这些人）的不被人理解的可观测事实。许多人认为这些个人及其行为是一种反常现象，但并未发觉它们示范了权力规则，提供了关于时代正确的、时代的、不过时的领导行为的重要经验。

Trump surely follows the seven rules of power I outline in this book. In fact I originally intended to write about the leadership lessons of Trump. I decided against it because he is such a polarizing figure that people find it hard to objectively watch what he does and evaluate it outside the context of Trump himself. However, in thinking about why Trump has been so unexpectedly successful in politics and other domains, I developed insights into not only the social science foundations that help explain his success, but also the behavior and outcomes achieved by many other corporate leaders and politicians in the United States and elsewhere.
特朗普当然遵循了我在本书描述的七条权力规则。实际上我最初打算写特朗普的领导力经验。但我改变了主意，因为他是个极端案例，除了设身处地的特朗普自己，其他人难以客观地看待和评价他的所作所为。然而，当思考为何特朗普在政治和其他领域如此出人意料地成功，我深入研究了有助于解释特朗普成功的社会科学根据，以及美国和其他国家许多其他企业家和政客的行为与成果。

Because people do not understand the behavioral realities of power, they are continually surprised by both what happens and the effectiveness of actions that seemingly violate conventional wisdom about leadership—mostly because much of this wisdom is largely untethered from research on the social psychology of human behavior. Sometimes the surprise is accompanied by unanticipated career setbacks that arise because people are unprepared for the realities of social life.
因为人们不理解权力行为的实际情况，人们不断惊讶于发生了什么，以及那些似乎违反领导力常规认知的行为的影响力——通常因为这些认知大多都来源于不受约束的社会心理学行为研究。有时这些惊讶还伴随着未曾预料的事业挫折，因为人们并没有对社会生活的真相做好准备。

My hope is that this book will help people better understand the everyday dynamics and political truths of organizations of all types, public and private. My explicit goal, stated in my Paths to Power course outline, is to provide people with the knowledge that, if implemented, can help them never have to leave a job involuntarily. Although I have not achieved that goal, as I still see too many people being ousted, the goal remains relevant and important. Teaching people how to put the seven rules of power into practice can help them achieve that objective.
我希望这本书能帮助人们更好地理解各种公开和非公开的组织动态和政治真相。如“权力之路”课程概述，我的明确目标是为人们提供知识，只要他们运用到实际中，就不会被贸然解雇。尽管我还没达成目标，因为我始终看到太多被革职的人，但这个目标依然意义重大。教会人们如何实操这七条权力规则能帮助他们达到目的。

### Power Is Not a “Dark” Art; It’s the Key to Success 权力不是“黑暗的”艺术，而是成功的关键

My third motivation for writing this new book: all too frequently I encounter people, either by email or in my courses, who initially express resistance, skepticism, discomfort, challenges, and similar feelings with the ideas I teach. Not because they doubt the ideas’ existence in the world or maybe even their validity founded on social science research or what they observe. To use the word of one recent email correspondent, they find the principles and research findings “depressing”—or, quoting my friend and colleague Bob Sutton, “dark.” Consequently, people eschew opportunities to make things happen and accelerate their careers as effectively as they might.
我写这本新书的第三个动机是：不论是电子邮件还是我的课程，我太过经常遇到这样一些人，他们一开始对我教授的观点表示出抗拒、怀疑、不适、挑战和相似的感受。并不是因为他们怀疑这些想法的真实存在。也不是社会科学研究。

I figured that one way to fight these perceptions was to provide people seven rules that, if they used them, would make them more powerful. Once people had more power, they would be much less depressed and experience the world as less dark, because they would be considerably more effective at getting things done as they navigated that world. They would also be physically and mentally healthier, because research shows that health is related to job control and one’s position in the social hierarchy, and happier, because power is associated with increased happiness.

### Have the Principles—the Rules—of Power Changed? 权力法则——规则——变了吗？

Fourth, I wanted to address directly the frequent narrative that today everything is different—fundamentally changed by new values, new generations (and their own new values), and new technologies, particularly social media—and therefore old ideas about power and influence are no longer relevant. That argument is why it is not surprising that people feel ambivalent about my class and writings, given the current attitude in business schools and other programs in leadership and administration. Power—and possibly even more so, organizational (or maybe all) politics—is on the outs.
