# IN THE BEGINNING 开始

**The Challenge of Power**
**权力的挑战**

> If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.
> 如果你希望权力被用在好的地方，那就应该让更多好人拥有权力。

I REGULARLY SUFFER A FORM of what might be called intellectual whiplash. On the one hand, people—even a good friend and insightful editor—tell me my ideas about power don’t fit the prevailing zeitgeist with its emphasis on collaboration, being nice, and enacting politically correct behavior. On the other hand, I get emails like the one from an individual enrolled in my online class on power. That person told me and his classmates that he learned that performance is not enough. Rather, he now knew he had to ask people in power in his company for what he wanted and needed to advance his career and achieve his job objectives and to flatter higher-ups; to believe in himself and act and speak with power; to build a network and support system; and, when confronting opposition and conflict, to be smart in how and when to fight his battles. And oh, by the way, he would miss my final live session because his network-building and “get noticed” efforts had resulted in his being on the corporate plane with two C-level officers to make an international market visit at the same time as the session.
我经常遭受到一种所谓的“智力鞭挞”。一方面，人们——甚至是我的一个富有洞察力的编辑朋友——告诉我，我对权力的看法不符合以合作、友好和政治正确为盛的主流时代思潮。另一方面，我收到像来自于参加我的在线权力课程的一位学生的一些邮件。这个人告诉我和他的同学们，他学到了只是表现是不够的。相反，他现在知道了，他需要向去他公司里的当权者索要他想得到的东西、发展事业、达成工作目标和奉承上级；去变得自信，言行充满权力；去搞关系和支持系统；以及，当面对竞争者和矛盾时，知道何时以及怎么去作战。顺带一提，他即将错过我的最后一堂直播课，因为课程的同时，他的社交和引人注目的努力使得他将在公司专机上和两位C级官员一起做一场国际化的市场考察。

So, what to believe about power? How to act—what to do? *7 Rules of Power* captures my current thinking and the most recent social science research to help you answer those questions.
所以，关于权力我们该相信什么？我们应该如何表现——即我们应该做什么？《权力七规则》一书涵盖了我当下的想法以及最新的社会科学研究，来帮你解答这些问题。

## WHY THIS BOOK, NOW? 为何现在写这本书？

I thought I would never write another book on power. I have written three, four if you count a prequel that confronts leadership aphorisms that are mostly untrue and unhelpful, like recommendations to be modest, authentic, and truthful. My last two books on power have done reasonably well, being used in classes literally worldwide; why this book, and why now?
我曾认为我不会再写任何关于权力的书了。我已经写了三本，如果你算上一本前传的话是四本，这本前传直面了像“求职介绍应该是谦虚、真实和可信的”这类领导力格言几乎是虚假和无用的。我最近的两本关于权力的书籍已经不出所料地成功，正在被广泛用于全球的课程中；我为何现在又要写这本书呢？

Four things changed my mind. First, I have continued my efforts to convey material on organizational power and politics ever more effectively. I have the privilege of doing so for some of the most talented people in the world, both online and in person. This activity has deepened my insights about how to simplify, clarify, and articulate more clearly the ideas behind rules of power—how and why people can take actions that, very practically and often quickly, will alter their career trajectories and their lives.
四件事改变了我的想法。首先，我继续努力去更加有效地输送与组织权力和政治相关的物料。我有特权去为世界上一些很有天赋的人做这些，包括在线和私下。这项活动加深了我的洞察力，关于如何更清晰地简化、阐明和表达我对权力规则的看法——如何以及为何人们能通过行动极其实际和迅速地改变事业轨迹和生活。

Students have shown me how learning the rules of power and their application can have profoundly positive and immediate effects. A recent, not unusual email:
学生们向我展示了如何学习权力规则，以及他们对这些规则的运用已经能够极大地产生正面和快速的影响。以下是一封最近并不罕见的电子邮件：

> *Thank you for all the lessons from your . . . class. It helped me start my own department, get a salary and title I never considered at my age, and today it got me praise from two ministers during an international signing ceremony. What’s the secret? I simply asked for things. I also took your advice of strategically placing myself in places where my . . . degrees and AI knowledge are considered very rare instead of common. Lastly, I invested in putting myself out there, networking with those at work, and building a name for myself.*
> 感谢你的……课堂上的每一节课。它帮助我建设自己的部门，获得我在这个年纪不敢想象的薪水和头衔，以及今天它使我在一个国际签署仪式上得到了两位部长的赞扬。这其中的秘密是什么？我只是简单地索取。我也听取了你的建议，把自己放在我的……学历和AI知识相较而言非常欠缺的位置。最后，我投入到放手一搏，和同事搞关系和建设个人品牌。
