# RULE 1 Get Out of Your Own Way 规则一：自我突破

SITTING IN MY OFFICE IS CHRISTINE, a former student from my class on power who did management consulting at one of the fancy firms before returning to business school. Now working for a prestigious Silicon Valley company in a marketing analytics role, she had recently completed a project that had a $4 million economic impact. The problem: She was one of four peers, and one of them had gone to their mutual boss with the suggestion that Christine and her group report to him. A smart move, because not only would he have downgraded a competitor, he could take credit for her group’s continuing outstanding work.

坐在我办公室里的是克里斯汀，一位之前参加过我权力课程的学生，她在回到商业学校前在一家高档企业做管理咨询。她目前在一家有声望的硅谷公司做市场分析，最近刚完成了一个四百万美元经济影响力的项目。问题是：她是四个成员之一，而其中一个成员去找他们共同的领导提议让克里斯汀和她的团队向他汇报。这是聪明的一招，因为他不仅打压了一个竞争对手，还能因为克里斯汀持续出色的工作而得到好评。

Christine, a woman of Asian origin, had been raised by her family to be polite, deferential, and to succeed on the basis of merit—hard work and good results. She tells me that before coming to see me to figure out a “paths to power” approach to her problem, as she called it, she tried a very different intervention. One of the most popular classes at Stanford’s business school, interpersonal dynamics—nicknamed “touchy-feely”—is a sensitivity training–based class that helps students build their interpersonal relationship skills as they become aware of how others see them.
